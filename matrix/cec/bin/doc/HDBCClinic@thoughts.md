**Expanding Scope Considerations**

I've been focusing on integrating these new keywords: "surgery," "dental treatment," and "transplants." I'm now thinking about how best to include them into the `README.md` file, considering their specific nature as medical services. I want to ensure the file reflects this expanded scope clearly and accurately, without disrupting the existing information architecture.


**Revising Placement Strategies**

I've been reconsidering the best placement for the new keywords. I'm leaning towards expanding the "Key Features" section to directly address "surgery," "dental treatment," and "transplants" as core functionalities. This approach provides a clearer and more direct representation of the system's capabilities. Additionally, a brief mention in the "About the Project" section to highlight the system's scope seems prudent.


**Prioritizing Integration Strategies**

I'm now focusing on the "About the Project" and "Key Features" sections. In "About the Project," I plan to subtly add the new medical keywords to highlight the system's adaptability. In "Key Features," I'm considering adding specific modules like "Surgery Management," "Dental Records," and "Transplant Tracking" to clearly showcase the expanded functionality. The "Usage" section feels less relevant for these keywords.


**Implementing Specific Module Details**

I'm presently working on refining the "Key Features" section. I've decided on the "Specialized Clinical Modules" subheading, and now I'm detailing each module. I plan to use brief, informative phrases. I'm focusing on the "Surgical Workflow Management," "Dental Treatment Charting," and "Transplant Coordination" modules, ensuring they capture their key functions concisely. I'm also reviewing existing descriptions to maintain consistency in style and tone.


**Implementing Scope Refinements**

I've been working on the integration of the medical services. I'm focusing on "Specialized Clinical Modules" under "Key Features." I'm creating entries for "Surgical Workflow Management," "Dental Treatment Charting," and "Transplant Coordination" now. I'm aiming for concise, descriptive language to highlight each module's core functions. I'm also revising "About the Project" to mention these specialties subtly.
